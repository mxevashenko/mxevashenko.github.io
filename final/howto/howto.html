    <div class="guide">
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Ever wanted to get into coding and don’t know where to start? Are you stuck wondering what you should do next? This step-by-step guide will help you figure out what your next steps are and provide tips on how to continue your journey.</p>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step One:</h2>
            <p>Find something YOU want to make. It could be something as small as a calculator or as big as No Man’s Sky. All that really matters is that you have the motivation to get up and go. If this step isn’t followed, you will not get past step 3.</p>
        
            <h2>Step Two:</h2>
            <p>Google everything. What tools do you need? What languages can you use? Google anything you’re unsure of. Someone somewhere has had the same issue as you and another someone knows how to fix that issue. This carries on throughout even beyond this guide as the internet is the most important tool for any programmer.</p>
                    
            <h2>Step Three:</h2>
            <p>Choose your languages and tools for the job and start. Find everything you need from IDE’s to databases to servers, sit down and let your ideas flow. This is the hardest step and once past it, your project has truly started.</p>
                    
            <h2>Step Four (optional):</h2>
            <p>Been stuck on the same problem for 2 hours? Go to sleep. Chances are when you come back, the answer will be obvious and you’ll wonder why you were stuck. It happens all too often that a break allows you to come back looking at a problem from a different angle.</p>
                    
            <h2>Step Five:</h2>
            <p>One you have something, anything functional, even just a square that moves left when you press the left arrow and still left when you press the right one, you did it! You made something. Doesn’t matter how useful or buggy it is because you have a tangible product that you should feel good about.</p>
                    
            <h2>Step Six:</h2>
            <p>Now you must choose weather you are still passionate about the current project, or have an even better idea. Once you find motivation, et yourself follow it. If you have not felt any sense of motivation or accomplishment the maybe programming isn’t for you. Always remember you can come back to it when the motivation hits without necessarily having to start over from step one.</p>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 60px;">With that, we reach the point where nobody knows what’s next other than yourself. You need to decide what kind of programmer you want to be. I hope this guide has lightened a path for you to continue your journey in computer programming. <br><br>Good Luck!</p>
