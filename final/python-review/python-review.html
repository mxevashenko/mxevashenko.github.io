            Python is used for data and simple tasks and is described as an easy to pick up language. My experience with python is not a positive one and here I’ll give 3 reasons as to why Python is not a good language.<br><br>
            There are symbols in coding that are used for the same thing no matter what language you’re using. For example, “&&” is used in between comparisons to signify “and”. Python breaks this pattern by using words instead of symbols. This makes sense as it is the literal word that the symbol represents but it only serves to make code harder to read.<br><br>
            Another factor for its poor readability is the removal of curly braces (“{ }”) to contain logic. It instead opts to use indentation as the replacement. This may sound better for readability but along with the other removed symbols only makes python code look like a wall of text without any separators. Since indentation has a purpose other that cleanliness, it is no longer an option like in every other language.<br><br>
            Not only are there removed features, but python is also missing private variables or constants. Most widely used languages have some way to keep a variable from being changed or read. Python has no such functionality meaning that variables that shouldn’t be changed can be accidentally changed without restriction.<br><br>
	        In conclusion, python is not a good language, especially for beginners as it teaches useless habits and is missing features. I would recommend C# as a better language for beginners. It was the first language I used and is widely used to make graphical apps, games, and any other type of application on both desktop and mobile.<br><br>
